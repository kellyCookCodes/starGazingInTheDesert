# README
    I'm going to keep this as a living document for the time being as I learn to update features in the future.
## DESCRIPTION
    1. I created this site to fulfill the requirements of a challenge project. It was to be for a local club. I live in the desert near the mountains and it is ideal for stargazing. There is less light polution. 
    There were requirements to be met:
       1. For a real or ficticious local club
       2. I got to choose everything about the page...club name, page layout & styling, any images I wanted to use, etc...
    2. As this is my second homepage type project, I thought that I might include a readme.md file, so I can get used to the markdown language and make a habbit of including a readme file.
    3. This project needed to demonstrate many of the responsive design tools I've learned so far. 
       1. I decided to go with a grid layout since my last project was flexbox. I really took my time with this project. I tried using 3 different types of grid syntax for layout and decided on the current one. Ideally, I think I should have practiced with Git and GitHub while I was playing around with the 3 differnt syntaxes and then had 3 differnt versions of the project...allow that does sound like a lot of work for myself. In hindsight it was probably for my own good that I kept it simple this time around.  
       2. I wanted to use percentages and relative units.
       3. I also incorporated some media queries to resize elements based on the size of the screen. 
    4. I went a little out of my scope on this project. I know that I will continue to work on this project as I learn new things I can impliment. 
       1. I really loved the banner img used, but I was having a hard time finding text that was easy to read over the top of the img. I wanted to transpose the gradient colors of the background image in the banner and the color of the text, but couldn't find a font on google font that did what I wanted. I did a little research and since someone already had the solution to this problem, I decided that I didn't need to reinvent the wheel. I stepped out of my comfort zone and tried using a webkit for the first time. However, the text in the middle where the color gradient muttles together was still a little hard to read. Since the drop shadow effect was broken due to the webkit I wanted to use, I had to research to find a workaround. I learned about the filter property and dropshadow value.
       2. I know that I would like to eventually have a drop down menu for the nav bar in use on smaller screen sizes. I've added some of the syntax as a place holder for my future self to improve this project later as I better learn about Git, GitHub, functions, and variables and how it should all piece together later.

## HOW TO RUN THE REPO
    More to come about this, as I learn more about it I will be updating this section.
## TECH STACK
    This project was intended to use just HTML5 and CSS3. However, I did use some webkits as well as a little JavaScript that will be worked on later. As I learn more, this section will be updated.
## DESIGN
    I"ve used grid as part of this layout. There is a fixed nav bar with a flat design and a club icon that matches the flavicon in the window tab.  I got all of my images from [unsplash.com](https://www.unsplash.com) I found the banner picture and built the color scheme from that. Added a webkits that allowed me to fill the color of the shadow and another to make the shadow clip the text. Then used the filler property with a value of dropshadow to add a drop shadow back behind the text to make the part in the middle where the colors muttle together in the gradient easier to read and pop more.
## FEATURES
    There is a favicon used (telescope) in the page tab. Reused the favicon as a icon in the navigation bar as well. h1, h2, and h3 all have webkits in use for the gradient color in the text as well as the filter property with the shadow text value. The nav bar switches to a menu button that will be a dropdown list and will be updated while practicing in Git and GitHub. Still need to fix the onclick() function for the navigation bar menu button for use on smaller devices. Will revisit this project as I learn more. Use of percentages and media querries make for a responsive site. There are social media icons used in the footer to be used as links.
## HOW TO RUN THE PROJECT
    This will be updated later as the project evolves more. For the meantime, the site is intended to be used to join a ficticious club after filling out a form at the bottom of the page. This club meets in the california desert once a month for stargazing without all of the light polution from the city.
